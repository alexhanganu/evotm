Description: # time management app (tm) (habit tracker / habit changer / brain-body reprogramming)
        
        tasks can be added and monitored.
        can add deadlines to tasks
        can add minimal duration per day for tasks
        
        tm shows nr of days left until deadline
        tm shows nr of days a task has been performed more then the minimal daily duration.
        
        tm's goals:
        = keep track of tasks and deadline
        = complete tasks before deadline
        = differentiate between job tasks and personal development tasks.
        = train for consistency.
        = see the required average time to complete a task
        
        Example of Personal development tasks:
        - learning something (talking, writing, fast reading, scripting)
        - sport/ fitness
        - training emotional/ behavioral patterns (to stay calm in any situation, to always be aware about the tone/ voice that is being used; train the handshake, the smile, watching people in the eyes, gratitude, posture, awareness about something)
        - perform cognitive training/ enhancement of cognitive performance (for memory, attention, working memory, reaction time, visual field, color distinction, sound distinction, sound intensity, taste distinction, taste intensity, smell distinction, body feelings, skin sensations, external(skin)/internal(body) vibrations, heart beats, bowel movements, eye movements, whole bode movements, vibration in the feet (internal/ external), hair vibrations, muscle relaxation).
        
        
        Philosophy:
        = tasks that are being done daily impose brain and body adaptation in order for the human biological system to adjust and perform a task at the best possible performance level by using the minimal possible energy/time/resources.
        = Procrastination is just a task learned by the body and the brain. It can be unlearned.
        = tasks can include job chores as well as personal development tasks (learn something, train behavioral patterns). This allows to understand which are the personal interest and with time allows to align the job tasks with personal interest tasks.
        = our brain searches and invent reasons why certain tasks should/must not be done (more details in Daniel Kahneman "Thinking fast and slow").
        = common brain plasticity levels are: 40 days of consistent repetition (commencement of brain reorganization and initiation of automation processes); second level would be around 3-6 months (significant number of cells are renewed and based on the novel behavioral pattern, while cells that used the previous behavioural patterns have died; the new cells that were born, during their whole life cycle they activated in an environement with the new behavioral rules and patterns, e.g., reading at least one page every day - meaning this all they know).
        = third level is after 3 years, when the almost all the cells in our body (except neurons) will be renewed and these new cells will have been trained every day to perform certain tasks. The whole body will consider it a normal state to perform a certain task. Absence of a certain task - can induce neuropsychiatric symptoms - anxiety/depression/apathy.

        For the link with Google Calendar check:
        https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
        
        1) Turn on the Google Calendar API
        2) Download Client Configuration and save to file "credentials.json"
        3) mv credentials.json to ~/calendar_credentials.json
        4) Connect to your google account, change in account -> security -> Access to application less secure -> activate
        5) Restart connection -> authorize quickstart to access the calendar -> a message is received: "Authencitication is complete"
